                When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master.
                If you're not with me, then you're my enemy!
                Your destiny lies with me Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
                I don't want to hear anymore about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me.
                Don't you turn against me.
                A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

                    Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
                    I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
                    I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
